Caveats:
1. As of April 3, 2017, the underlying cause of death has been revised for 125 deaths in 2014. More information:
http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/ucd.html#2014-Revision.
2. Data for Prince of Wales-Hyder Census Area, AK (FIPS code 02198), Hoonah-Angoon Census Area, AK (FIPS code 02105), Skagway
Municipality, AK (FIPS code 02230), Petersburg Borough/Census Area, AK (FIPS code 02195) and Wrangell City and Borough, AK (FIPS
code 02275) are only available for 2014 and later; for computational purposes, counts and population estimates for 2013 and
earlier are set to zero. Thus, counts and rates shown in multi-year requests for this entity do not include any data for years
before 2014, only data for 2014 and later. More information: http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/ucd.html#Alaska2014.
3. Data for Prince of Wales-Outer Ketchikan Census Area, AK (FIPS code 02201), Skagway-Hoonah-Angoon Census Area, AK (FIPS code
02232) and Wrangell-Petersburg Census Area, AK (FIPS code 02280) are only available for 2013 and earlier; for computational
purposes, counts and population estimates for 2014 and later are set to zero. Thus, counts and rates shown in multi-year
requests for this entity do not include any data for years after 2013, only data for 2013 and earlier. More information:
http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/ucd.html#Alaska2014.
4. Data for Bedford city, Va. (FIPS code 51515) are only available for 2013 and earlier; for computational purposes, counts and
population estimates for 2014 and later are set to zero. Thus, counts and rates shown in multi-year requests for this entity do
not include any data for years after 2014, only data for 2013 and earlier. More information:
http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/ucd.html#Bedford.
5. There is a discontinuity in the mortality and population data for Bedford County (FIPS code 51019) between years 2013 and
2014. The discontinuity occurs because Bedford City, Virginia (FIPS code 51515), formerly an independent city, merged with
Bedford County (FIPS code 51019) on July 1, 2013. Beginning in 2014, deaths and population counts for Bedford City, Virginia
(FIPS code 51515) are included in Bedford County (FIPS code 51019).
6. Death rates for Clifton Forge city, Virginia (FIPS code 51560) are available only for 1999-2000. For 2001 and beyond, death
counts and population estimates for Clifton Forge city have been combined with those for Alleghany county, Virginia (FIPS code
51005). Death counts and population estimates for this entity from multi-year requests, only reflect data from 1999 and 2000;
for 2001 and beyond they have been set to zero. More information: http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/ucd.html#Clifton Forge.
7. Deaths and population estimates are shown separately from the adjacent counties for Carson City, Nevada (FIPS code 32510).
8. Deaths and population estimates are reported separately for Baltimore City (FIPS code 24510) and Baltimore county (FIPS code
24005).
9. Deaths and population estimates are reported separately for St. Louis City (FIPS code 29510) and county (FIPS code 29189).
10. Data are Suppressed when the data meet the criteria for confidentiality constraints. More information:
http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/ucd.html#Assurance of Confidentiality.
11. Death rates are flagged as Unreliable when the rate is calculated with a numerator of 20 or less. More information:

12. The population figures for year 2017 are bridged-race estimates of the July 1 resident population, from the Vintage 2017
postcensal series released by NCHS on June 27, 2018. The population figures for year 2016 are bridged-race estimates of the July
1 resident population, from the Vintage 2016 postcensal series released by NCHS on June 26, 2017. The population figures for
year 2015 are bridged-race estimates of the July 1 resident population, from the Vintage 2015 postcensal series released by NCHS
on June 28, 2016. The population figures for year 2014 are bridged-race estimates of the July 1 resident population, from the
Vintage 2014 postcensal series released by NCHS on June 30, 2015. The population figures for year 2013 are bridged-race
estimates of the July 1 resident population, from the Vintage 2013 postcensal series released by NCHS on June 26, 2014. The
population figures for year 2012 are bridged-race estimates of the July 1 resident population, from the Vintage 2012 postcensal
series released by NCHS on June 13, 2013. The population figures for year 2011 are bridged-race estimates of the July 1 resident
population, from the Vintage 2011 postcensal series released by NCHS on July 18, 2012. Population figures for 2010 are April 1
Census counts. The population figures for years 2001 - 2009 are bridged-race estimates of the July 1 resident population, from
the revised intercensal county-level 2000 - 2009 series released by NCHS on October 26, 2012. Population figures for 2000 are
April 1 Census counts. Population figures for 1999 are from the 1990-1999 intercensal series of July 1 estimates. Population
figures for the infant age groups are the number of live births. <br/><b>Note:</b> Rates and population figures for years 2001 -
2009 differ slightly from previously published reports, due to use of the population estimates which were available at the time
of release.
13. The population figures used in the calculation of death rates for the age group 'under 1 year' are the estimates of the
resident population that is under one year of age. More information: http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/ucd.html#Age Group.
