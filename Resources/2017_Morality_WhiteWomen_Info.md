Caveats:
1. Data are Suppressed when the data meet the criteria for confidentiality constraints. More information:
http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/ucd.html#Assurance of Confidentiality.
2. Death rates are flagged as Unreliable when the rate is calculated with a numerator of 20 or less. More information:
http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/ucd.html#Unreliable.
3. Deaths of persons with Age "Not Stated" are included in "All" counts and rates, but are not distributed among age groups,
so are not included in age-specific counts, age-specific rates or in any age-adjusted rates. More information:
http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/ucd.html#Not Stated.
4. Information included on the death certificate about the race and Hispanic ethnicity of the decedent is reported by the
funeral director as provided by an informant, often the surviving next of kin, or, in the absence of an informant, on the basis
of observation. Race and ethnicity information from the census is by self-report. To the extent that race and Hispanic origin
are inconsistent between these two data sources, death rates will be biased. More information:

5. The population figures for year 2017 are bridged-race estimates of the July 1 resident population, from the Vintage 2017
postcensal series released by NCHS on June 27, 2018. The population figures for year 2016 are bridged-race estimates of the July
1 resident population, from the Vintage 2016 postcensal series released by NCHS on June 26, 2017. The population figures for
year 2015 are bridged-race estimates of the July 1 resident population, from the Vintage 2015 postcensal series released by NCHS
on June 28, 2016. The population figures for year 2014 are bridged-race estimates of the July 1 resident population, from the
Vintage 2014 postcensal series released by NCHS on June 30, 2015. The population figures for year 2013 are bridged-race
estimates of the July 1 resident population, from the Vintage 2013 postcensal series released by NCHS on June 26, 2014. The
population figures for year 2012 are bridged-race estimates of the July 1 resident population, from the Vintage 2012 postcensal
series released by NCHS on June 13, 2013. The population figures for year 2011 are bridged-race estimates of the July 1 resident
population, from the Vintage 2011 postcensal series released by NCHS on July 18, 2012. Population figures for 2010 are April 1
Census counts. The population figures for years 2001 - 2009 are bridged-race estimates of the July 1 resident population, from
the revised intercensal county-level 2000 - 2009 series released by NCHS on October 26, 2012. Population figures for 2000 are
April 1 Census counts. Population figures for 1999 are from the 1990-1999 intercensal series of July 1 estimates. Population
figures for the infant age groups are the number of live births. <br/><b>Note:</b> Rates and population figures for years 2001 -
2009 differ slightly from previously published reports, due to use of the population estimates which were available at the time
of release.
6. The population figures used in the calculation of death rates for the age group 'under 1 year' are the estimates of the
resident population that is under one year of age. More information: http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/ucd.html#Age Group.
