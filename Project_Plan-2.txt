CANCER STATISTICS- 2007 - 2015 Mortality (Lung Cancer)

Hypotheses: 

Null Hypothesis(H0):There is no relationship between race and lung cancer mortality within 2015
Alternative Hypothesis(H1):There is a relationship between race and lung cancer mortality within 2015

Null Hypothesis(H0):There is no relationship between poverty and lung cancer mortality within 2015
Alternative Hypothesis(H1):There is a relationship between poverty and lung cancer mortality within 2015

Analysis on one of the six leading causes of death- Lung Cancer Mortality(according to WHO-World Health Organization) on a national level in 2015 This analysis will focus on disparities within demographicsin relation to lung cancer mortality to determine viable relationships and/or correlations between the varaibles. 

Demographics include:
1. Race 
2. Poverty Rate
3. Gender
4. Age
5. Geography
 
Specifically, does gender,race, age, poverty, and geographic disparties exist within lung cancer mortality across the United States in 2015. 

Then we narrowed down to race and poverty.
-Mechanisms underlying racial differences in lung cancer deaths may be confounded by socioecnomic factors such as poverty rate. 

What is more determinative on lung cancer mortality, race or poverty?



Hypotheses: 

Null Hypothesis(H0):There is no relationship between race and lung cancer mortality within 2015
Alternative Hypothesis(H1):There is a relationship between race and lung cancer mortality within 2015

Null Hypothesis(H0):There is no relationship between poverty and lung cancer mortality within 2015
Alternative Hypothesis(H1):There is a relationship between poverty and lung cancer mortality within 2015

Statisical Testing:

We decided to conduct a Chi-Square test on race and lung cancer mortality for 2015 using a p-value of 0.001. After conducting the test, we decided to reject the null hypothesis since the chi-square (10042.59) value exceeds the critical value (16.27) and accept the alternative hypothesis which states that there is a realtionship between race and lung cancer mortality within 2015. 



1. Line graph - over 10 years cancer deaths by race
- Brown- update with more years from new csv files and adjust values to be crude rate, not total
2. Poverty and Cancer state Bar charts - poverty by state side by side with cancer crude rate deaths - Mike
- Gretel- update Abear's code and give to Mike
- Mike will combine the two bar charts into 1
3. Scatter plot of cancer rate w/ poverty rate - match by county
- line of best fit
4. Pie chart - 
- Gretel - chi sq hypothesis test
5. Gender bar chart 
- Brown - update gender bar chart to include 10 years of data

Analysis on one of the six leading causes of death- Lung Cancer (according to WHO-World Health Organization) on a national level within in each state from 2001-2015. This analysis will target analyze risk factors/socioeconomic demographics in relation to lung cancer mortality to determine viable relationships and/or correlations between the varaibles. 


 

Variables- 
Independent Variables:

	Socioeconomic characteristics of the population (per state):
	3. Race
	4. Gender
