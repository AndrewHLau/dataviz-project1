CANCER STATISTICS- 2007 - 2015 Mortality (Lung Cancer)
Analysis on one of the six leading causes of death- Lung Cancer (according to WHO-World Health Organization) on a national level within in each state from 2001-2015. This analysis will target analyze risk factors/socioeconomic demographics in relation to lung cancer mortality to determine viable relationships and/or correlations between the varaibles. 

Variables-
Independent Variables: 
	1. States (All U.S. States- National Level)
	2. Year(8 Year time frame) 2007-2015

	Socioeconomic characteristics of the population (per state):
	3. Race
	4. Gender
	5. Age Groups: 
	6. Poverty Rate % yrs (2012-2017)

Dependent Variables:
	1.Cancer Sites- Lung and Bronchus
	2. Death and population from the Census-

	
Core Hypothesis: ?

Research Questions:
 
	1. Compare Lung Cancer deaths within each state over (2007-2015) time interval. 
	a. Which state had a significant trendline over the 8 year timeframe? 
	b. Compare total lung cancer deaths of all states per year. 
	c. Analyze trendlines for high/low peaks per state- note which year has a significant low or high peak for each state? 
	***(Analyze a peak or something interesting within the trendlines to decide on specific year for analysis on the following questions) :
	
	2. Which state has the greatest/lowest number of lung cancer deaths? Analyze by the following:
		•  Race- Which race had the highest/lowest number of lung cancer deaths per state?
		• Gender- Which gender is associated with highest/lowest number of lung cancer deaths within each state?
		• Age- Determine which age groups had the highest/lowest number of lung cancer deaths within each state?

	3. Lunger Cancer and poverty rate % assoication per state. Is there a relationship between poverty and lung cancer?  

	
Charts:
1.a.Line graph- trend line of lung cancer mortality on a national level/nationwide over time from 2007-2015. 
X- axis: Years/ Y-axis: Total of Lung Cancer deaths
-By Race (different lines/colors per race)
1.b.Line graph- trendline of lung cancer mortality on a national level/nationwide over time from 2007-2015
X- axis: Years/ Y-axis: Total of Lung Cancer deaths
-By Gender (different lines/colors per gender)
1.c.Line graph- trend line of lung cancer mortality on a national level/nationwide over time from 2007-2015 
X- axis: Years/ Y-axis: Total of Lung Cancer deaths
-By Age (different lines/colors per age group)

2*** Pick a significant year from line graph from above ^^
3*** Then compare States to see which states had the highest/lowest mortality of deaths(bar chart- align states on side, figure out formatting later)
4*** Pick the state with the highest total mortality lung deaths and a state with the lowest mortality lung deaths and then compare the following for each state:
   5- Race (pie chart)  ------------------------------> for low/high state 
   6- Gender(pie chart) ------------------------------> for low/high state
   7-Age (line graph)  ------------------------------> for low/high state

8. Heatmaps of Poverty rate and Lung Cancer Mortality per state/national level- Total gun deaths, homicides, suicides, poverty rate per county.
