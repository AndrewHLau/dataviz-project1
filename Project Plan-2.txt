Research Questions:
 
	1. Compare gun deaths within each state over the 10 yr (2008-2017) time period. 
	a. Which state had a significant trendline over the 10 years? 
	b. Analyze trendlines for high/low peaks per state- note which year has a significant low or high peak for each state? 
	***(Analyze a peak or something interesting within the trendlines to decide on specific year for analysis on the following questions) :
