CANCER STATISTICS- 2007 - 2015 Mortality (Lung Cancer)
Analysis on one of the six leading causes of death- Lung Cancer (according to WHO-World Health Organization) on a national level within in each state from 2001-2015. This analysis will target analyze risk factors/socioeconomic demographics in relation to lung cancer mortality to determine viable relationships and/or correlations between the varaibles. 

Variables-
Independent Variables: 
	1. States (All U.S. States- National Level)
	2. Year(8 Year time frame) 2007-2015

	Socioeconomic characteristics of the population (per state):
	3. Race
	4. Gender
	5. Age Groups
	6. Poverty Rate % yrs (2012-2017)

Dependent Variables:

	2. Death and population from the Census-

	
Core Hypothesis: ?

Research Questions:
 
	1. Compare Lung Cancer deaths within each state over (2007-2015) time interval. 
	a. Which state had a significant trendline over the 8 year timeframe? 
	b. Compare total lung cancer deaths of all states per year. 
	c. Analyze trendlines for high/low peaks per state- note which year has a significant low or high peak for each state? 
	***(Analyze a peak or something interesting within the trendlines to decide on specific year for analysis on the following questions) :
	
	2. Which state has the greatest/lowest number of lung cancer deaths? Analyze by the following:
		•  Race- Which race had the highest/lowest number of lung cancer deaths per state?
		• Gender- Which gender is associated with highest/lowest number of lung cancer deaths within each state?
		• Age- Determine which age groups had the highest/lowest number of lung cancer deaths within each state?

	3. Lunger Cancer and poverty rate % assoication per state. Is there a relationship between poverty and lung cancer?
