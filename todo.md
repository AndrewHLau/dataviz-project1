## To do:

I put together this list of stuff we need to do to make our project better based on Zach's input, and I created a README file based on our presentation and project plan. I tried to distill it down and make it clear and pretty, but please propose any changes you think should be there. Note - the images will not show until the Image folder is created.

I figured since I pushed a gazillion changes to the repository, someone else should do this stuff. I would recommend a new branch for each type of change, even if it is a pain in the ass, to show that you've done multiple changes.

### To prevent merge conflicts:
* Every time you are going to open a branch, slack the entire team to let everyone know what files you will be touching. Then slack again when you create a pull request.
* Do not let a branch sit open in your local drive for an extended period of time. If you are going to get up from the computer, commit that branch, push, pull, etc. You can open up that same branch later to finish your changes. 
* If you accidentally touch a file that you didn't make changes to, do not add that file to be committed, commit and push all the other changes and then create a pull request at GitHub. Once your merge is approved, go into the terminal and do a git stash to ignore your other changes, and then do a git pull to your master branch.

1. Review README.md and make any necessary changes.
2. Delete all png files from Output file.
3. Create Images folder.
4. Change code in Data_Analysis.ipynb notebook so that all images are saved in Images folder instead of Output folder.
5. Run Data_Analysis.ipynb notebook so that the images are created.
6.  Fix first markdown section called "Create Scatter Plot for County Level Data" to read "Create Scatter Plot for State Level Data."
7. Delete project plan word document (once README file is read and approved by everyone)
8. Export and upload powerpoint presentation into GitHub repository:  (https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/12_b-4s8xtf8IucRiZylp4wBKrkdu9dfZWrlzIlaAhwI/edit?usp=sharing)
9. OPTIONAL - someone delete Brown and Abear's code so they can add it back in and get credit for changes in GitHub -- Bear and Abear, you can do this between yourselves or let me know if you want me to delete your stuff so you can add back in.
10. Delete this To Do List.
